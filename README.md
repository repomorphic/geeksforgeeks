# Geeksforgeeks as Books


## Note

Complete books are located in the `book` [branch](https://github.com/gnijuohz/geeksforgeeks-as-books/tree/book).

Books will be updated regularly to keep up with [Geeksforgeeks.org](http://geeksforgeeks.org).

[Geeksforgeeks.org](http://geeksforgeeks.org) has (finally) updated its user interface lately and optimized for mobile devices. This project started when the old geeksforgeeks site was clumsy.

## Books

*New*: Complete books are located in the `book` [branch](https://github.com/gnijuohz/geeksforgeeks-as-books/tree/book)

**Note**: Books in the master branch is not actively updated and maintained anymore. Instead get the books in the `book` branch. The `book` branch will be merged into the `master` branch in the future. The code in the master branch was hacked together when I just got to know `Scrapy` and `lxml`. So fair warning, it's not pretty if you decide to take a look at the code.

*Old*: To get the latest version of the books, look under the directory called goodies. Each book under `geeksforgeeks-books` is generated with articles under a tag/category on [geeksforgeeks.org][1]. The book under `leetcode-book` is generated from the articles on [leetcode.com](http://leetcode.com/).


## App

There is an App now! [Geeksforgeeks Reader](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/geekreader/id991254978?ls=1&mt=8) makes it easier to read on your iOS devices. This app just got started. Feature requests are welcome.

For people who use leetcode, there is an app as well: [Leetcoder](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/leetcoder/id1069760709?mt=8).

## Tools

If you want to generate the books yourself. Here is an incomplete guide.

### Requirements

1. install [Scrapy][2]. It's is used to download webpages from `geeksforgeeks` and `leetcode`. It follows the next page link and downloads webpages.

    Install it with `pip install scrapy`. I created two separate scrapy projects called `geeksforgeeks` and `leetcode` to download wepages from the sites.

2. [lxml][10] and [Boilerpipy][6] (or [BeautifulSoup][11]). After downloading the html files, you need to extract the articles from them, I'm using `Boilerpipy` because it can handle webpages with different layout. But if you are only interested in the `geeksforgeeks` site, you can just use `lxml` to extract the articles. It will probably be faster too.

    `Boilerpipy` also removes the title of an article sometimes. So I had to do some post-processing with `lxml` after to add the title back.

3. [Pandoc][3]. It's used to convert html files or markdown files to epub, pdf and docx format files. The latex engine used in Pandoc can't handle gif images so only a few pdf books have been generated so far.

4. [kindlegen][4] is needed to generate `mobi` files for reading on Kindle or the Kindle App.
5. [WordCloud][5]. The book covers are generated with `wordcloud` with a bit of meta in mind.

#### Ubuntu Quick Installation Guide

```
pip install scrapy
pip install boilerpipy
pip install matplotlib
pip install wordcloud
pip install kindlegen
sudo apt-get install python-tk 
sudo apt-get install pandoc
```

## How To

1. **Crawling with Scrpay.** Go to the `geeksforgeeks` subdirectory and run commands *like* `scrapy crawl geeksforgeeks -a category=category -a name=name`.

    For example, running `scrapy crawl geeksforgeeks -a category=tag -a name=pattern-searching` will crawl from the page `http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tag/pattern-searching/`. category and name are two arguments the spider takes. On geeksforgeeks, things can be organized by `tag` or `category`. Specify the category/tag and the name, Scrapy will do the rest for you.

2. **Generate a book.** Now go into the `geeksforgeeks-books` subdirectory and you should be able to find a directory called `pattern-searching`. Now run `python generate_book.py pattern-searching 1.0`. It will clean the html files, concatenate the cleaned files into one html file, then use `pandoc` to create an epub and pdf format files from the it. In the end a mobi file is created using `kindlegen`.


## To Do

### Style the books
Style the books better. Those books are essentially styled via `css`. Therefore styling `<pre>` and `<code>`, for instance, will style the code of the `epub` books.

### Generate pdf format books
Convert `gif` images to `png` and use them instead so `pandoc` can handle them.

## Contribute

### Book

Every tag or category on `geeksforgeeks.org` can be turned into a book. So you are welcome to add/suggest more books.

### Style

The style for generating `epub` books is under `styles` subdirectory. `epub` books are styled via `css`. Welcome to submit your stylesheets.
